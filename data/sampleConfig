# spells must be on their own lines, and different names seperated
# with a comma, leading and trailing spaces allowed.

# For example:

# Configuration for spells for the "spellcasting" class type

# Name displayed	code-name

# Cantrips	spells[0]
weak spell, pissy spell  ,  gneric curse
# this is allowed, although very ugly


# Lvl 1			spells[1]
somespell, otherspell, mehchaspell #4, megaspell #1
# do it like this

# Although ugly, the tabbed nature looks good when printed out,
# so it is important to test the spacing for asthetics.
# Leadin/Trailing spaces will not be stripped, because they are
# used for spacing.
# It would be a good idea to only use spacing on the value portion,
# as we may need to look for a key, without having to worry about
# all these sorts of spaces.
# Dicitonaries will be in this format:

Greataxe=1d12 slashing
Battleaxe=1d8  slashing
Flail=	1d8  bludgeoning
Glaive=	1d10 slashing
Halberd=	1d10 slashing
